Experimental Mods:
* [DonateBundleAnywhere](DonateBundleAnywhere)

To Clone this repo, you need to add the `---recursive` parameter to the `git clone` command, because this repo referenced some shared projects from the Pathoschild's [StardewMods](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods) to avoid copying and reinventing wheels.  
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/LinHuiGD/StardewValleyMods.git`  
Because there are many projects in Pathoschild's StardewMods, which are not not referenced by this repo, you can use the script `checkout_submodules.sh` to **exclude the unused projects**. For windows users, you can run it in git bash.
